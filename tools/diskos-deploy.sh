# diskos-deploy.sh - push a locally built mq_ui to the device and hot-reload it, safely.
#
# This is for iterating on UI changes. A hand-deployed binary reverts to the flashed build on the
# next reboot (that is intentional). To bake a build in permanently, flash it with the installer.
#
# Usage:
#   DISKOS_IP=<device-ip> DISKOS_PW=<debug-mode-password> ./diskos-deploy.sh [path/to/mq_ui]
#
# Get the IP and a one-time SSH password from Debug Mode on the device (Settings > System). The
# password is regenerated on every enable and does not survive a reboot.
#
# Requires: sshpass, ssh, scp, md5sum. Default binary path: ./mq_ui

#    IMPORTANT: only ever touch mq_ui. NEVER kill mq_player - that frees the SD card and the
#    hardware MCU reboots the whole device (~10s).
#    The fiio_init watchdog does `pgrep -x mq_ui` (matches the full argv[0]); if we kill mq_ui
#    without immediately relaunching a DETACHED replacement it respawns the STOCK /usr/bin/mq_ui.
#    We relaunch with setsid </dev/null, then POLL until our build is confirmed alive, and only
#    THEN prune any stock instance. If our build never comes up (a bad binary), we do NOT prune -
#    the watchdog restores the stock UI as a working fallback.
# The remote block deliberately does NOT use `set -e`: it relies on `[ test ] && cmd` idioms and poll
# loops where a false test is normal, and `set -e` would abort the script on the first false test.
# Every step that must not fail is checked explicitly instead.
