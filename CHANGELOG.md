# Changelog

All notable changes to diskOS Disco! (and the diskOS releases underneath) are documented here.

Entries follow the Keep a Changelog format, with Added, Changed, and Fixed categories where applicable.
diskOS remains beta software; version numbers do not imply broad hardware or feature validation.

## [Disco! 1.0.1] - 2026-10-07

A stability fix for talking to the player, and a CD look for Immersive. Settings > About shows "Disco! 1.0.1".

### Added
- **Disco Options > Immersive: Vinyl or CD.** CD replaces the grooves and dark label with a clear CD hub, a faint
  rainbow sheen over the disc and thin rainbow spokes. The sheen and spokes stay still while the cover spins (like
  light on a real CD); the dark shade behind the lyrics is the same as with Vinyl.

### Changed
- Working mode: "Local playback" is now "Playback"; while a mode changes, spinning arrows replace the "Switching..."
  text (and a tap during a switch is ignored instead of toasting); taller rows in Disco.
- The mode screens (USB storage, USB DAC, Bluetooth DAC, AirPlay) drop their "Local" button; "Modes" leads back.

### Fixed
- **"Player didn't respond" at start-up, and playback that sometimes wouldn't start** when changing tracks or starting a
  list. The player's command mailbox holds 20 messages and the player stops reading it while it is busy (starting up,
  rebuilding a playlist). Background "what's playing?" requests filled it up, and a command that didn't fit was dropped
  after ~15 ms - sometimes half of the three-step play start (output, mode, play), which left the player unable to play.
  Now a command that doesn't fit waits, in order, and goes out as soon as the player reads again (it only fails, with
  the toast, after 6 s of a silent player); background requests are only sent when the mailbox is nearly empty; and
  the 6 s "Couldn't start playback" timer starts when the play command actually reaches the player.
- At a cold start the player creates its mailbox only after a while; commands sent before that now wait for it (up to
  30 s while the player hasn't answered yet) instead of failing at once with "Player didn't respond".

## [Disco! 1.0] - 2026-10-06

The fork becomes **diskOS Disco!**, with the new **Disco** theme as the default. Built on Fork 1.2.4 (diskOS 1.2.4
underneath). Settings > About shows "Disco! 1.0". Ring, Braun and Stone are still in Display > Theme.

### Added
- **Disco theme** (dark and light, plus Automatic Appearance): the playing album's cover as the interface; sharp on
  Music, blurred and tinted behind every other screen; glass panels; an optional CD-rainbow rim sheen.
- **The navigation circle**: a shard on the right rim that opens into a circle for moving between sections; hold for
  Music. Its sections are configurable (Display > Disco Options > Disco Menu); Music and Settings can't be removed.
- **Music**: clock, status icons and weather over the cover; large title and artist (scroll five times, then "...");
  a seekable rainbow progress line with elapsed / remaining times; transport on an arc; a play-mode button that cycles
  modes with a toast; text and fades that stay readable on any cover.
- **Title menu** (tap the title): Favourite, Album (the song highlighted), Artist (the album highlighted), Queue,
  Lyrics, Immersive.
- **Disco Options** (Display): Disco Menu, Show Clock, Track Times, Rim Sheen, Equalizer colours, Volume colours,
  Progress Bar (Disco / Accent / Off), **Progress Shape** (Linear, or an Arc around the rim from just below the open
  menu, clockwise, to just above it), **Title Position** (Centred / Left), **Title Hold** (Immersive / Favourite /
  Nothing).
- Disco versions of Quick Settings, Settings, Equalizer (rainbow faders), Volume (hub field + rim arc), Standby,
  Weather (current conditions + next 12 hours), Working mode, Shortcuts, Search (landing page with recent searches,
  full-screen keyboard, artists first), Queue / Up Next, Battery, the back / home swipe bubbles and the rescan dot.
- **Battery** page: charge ring, time left at the recent pace, playing and screen-on time for the last 24 hours.
- Search finds artists as well as songs.
- A crash recorder (the last screens and the crash address) in the boot log, for diagnosis.

### Changed
- Music is first in the navigation dots; Settings > Display hides Now Playing / Disc Colour / Saver Style in Disco.
- Settings re-sync after a player restart is silent and retried, so the "Player didn't respond" toast is gone at start.
- Helpers (update checks, downloads, Last.fm, the Bluetooth codec probe, app launch, restart, RTC save) start with
  posix_spawn instead of fork(), which can fail for memory with a UI this size; the Default UI choice is written by a
  small thread.
- Battery history keeps about 25 hours (what the screen uses), so each save writes 12 KB instead of 80 KB.
- Settings are only written when something changed.
- Lighter drawing: the navigation-circle glow, the Quick Settings cover glow and the progress knobs are plain rings
  instead of blurred shadows (those were redrawn on every frame or every second); the progress arc draws its track
  only where there is no fill.

### Fixed
- **SD-card updates were always rejected as "damaged"**: the UI starts with stdin/stdout closed, so the update folder
  could land on fd 0/1 and be replaced by the checker's own output. Descriptors 0..2 are now filled at start, and the
  last attempt is written to `/usr/data/updates/last_result`.
- An update checker that couldn't run (not started, timed out, killed) now says "Couldn't check the update" instead of
  "damaged"; update checks have a time limit and can no longer wait on an unrelated helper.
- Progress maths overflowed on tracks longer than about 36 minutes.
- Top-layer panels (title menu, Disco Menu editor) closed on any screen change (standby, keys).
- Search: recent searches use the full text; results are kept only when coming back to Search.
- Shortcut icons for Lyrics, Last.fm, Settings and apps were missing.
- Seeking could stay stuck "scrubbing"; the back / home bubbles showed while waking the screen or in Immersive and
  stayed armed after the swipe had become too slow to count; a bad saved swipe distance could divide by zero.
- Text overlaps in Working mode ("Switching...") and Quick Settings ("Scanning").
- Ring / Braun: Bluetooth streaming was routed as USB-audio output.
- Curved rows didn't give a shrunk value its width back; the title menu showed the cut-off title.
- Restart failures are noted in `/tmp/restart_last` with the real cause (was on the card, with a stale error).
- Battery estimate: stops at gaps, charges and level rises; no 24-hour totals without a set clock.

## [Fork 1.2.4] - 2026-10-05

### Added
- Hold a track in Songs, an album, or an artist's / genre's songs: Add to queue, Playlist, Favourite, Album, Artist, Info, Tags.
  A tap plays it on release only, so a hold never starts the song.
- Search: a Search button between the field and the keyboard; nothing is searched until it is pressed. Results open on
  their own page (title, artist · album, curved rows; tap plays, hold opens the track menu) with a back header that
  returns to the keyboard with the text kept.
- Backspace key on the search keyboard (tap = one character, hold = clear).

### Changed
- Search keys 46 px tall with 24 px letters, rows of 7 · 8 · 7 · 6 inside the circle.
- Action menu titles stay on one line ("...") instead of wrapping into the first item.

### Fixed
- The library-rescan runner around the rim is back (lost in the 1.2.0 merge).
- Ring ignored the Accent colour: a picked colour now wins over the album colour on Now Playing, Home, Quick Settings
  and the other music surfaces. Album mode is unchanged; Ring button borders keep the interface colour; Braun stays orange.

## [Fork 1.2.3] - 2026-10-05

Built on Fork 1.2.2. `mq_ui` md5 `de4915d4…` (the device-tested `89da2467…` build with the version set to 1.2.3).

### Added
- Hold an album, artist or genre: Play, Shuffle, Add to queue, Playlist (Add to queue implemented for whole groups).
- Swipe up from the bottom edge goes Home.

### Changed
- Settings > About shows 1.2.3 (was still 1.2.0).
- Library lists curve with the screen like History; the A-Z button moved to the edge; hint "Hold an item for more".
- Ring Now Playing: title 28 px, artist 20 px, matching Braun.
- Ring buttons: 2 px ring in the interface accent (red / lime on Ring Light), glyphs in the album colour.
- Braun ON/OFF knobs: pointer up in the icon colour (off) or 45 degrees orange (on); the lamp is gone.
- Braun Dark volume popup uses the charcoal surfaces.

### Performance
- Immersive: no drawing while the screen is dimmed or off; frames paced on render + compose + flush.
- Immersive: lyrics, hint and progress ring baked into the frame, refreshed only when they change.
- Immersive: rotation loop without per-pixel bounds tests (identical output).
- Theme pass skipped on frames where nothing was created (one-line counter in vendored LVGL).

### Fixed
- The EQ dial keeps its touch instead of starting a page swipe.

## [Fork 1.2.2] - 2026-10-05 - "SD card update"

First fork release on diskOS 1.2.0. Device-tested build: `mq_ui` md5 `84be467f…`.

### Added
- Update from SD Card: signed builds from `<SD>/diskos-update/`, verified on the Disc and installed at
  restart as a trial with automatic rollback. Owner key scripts in `ui/tools/owner-keys/`.
- Ring and Braun themes (with Ring Light, Braun Dark and Automatic Appearance) on top of upstream 1.2.0.
- Themed shutdown screen on a power-key hold; Ring screensaver styles.

### Changed
- Covers decoded inside `mq_ui` instead of the `diskos-artdec` helper.
- Theme list shows Ring, Braun and Stone; the other upstream themes are hidden, not removed.
- Upstream's Wi-Fi release key removed from `payload/`: the Disc trusts only the owner's key.

### Fixed
- Covers stopping after quick skips or album switches.
- Immersive record stuck at about 1 fps.
- Ring missing from Now Playing and Saver Style.
- Brightness reset after screen off/on.
- Equalizer values (the 1.2.1 EQ fix).

*Upstream diskOS history below, kept as released by b0hemia.*

## [1.2.0] - 2026-10-02

Adds V2.57 firmware support, more library and display choices, and signed in-app diskOS updates.
Installing 1.2.0 requires the complete installer and a new flash.

### Added

- Install from unmodified official V2.57 firmware, alongside V2.09, V2.28, and V2.40. The
  installer checks the Disc's existing kernel and recovery against the image before writing.
- Seven themes alongside Default, dark and light appearance, Outdoor Mode, font sizes, and an
  interface language choice with English fallback for missing text.
- Up Next shows the current queue and lets you jump to an upcoming song. Artists and Genres can
  open albums or All Songs.
- Library indexing for AAC, OGG, APE, AIFF, WMA, DSF, DFF, DTS, external CUE sheets, and SACD ISO
  track rows. Indexing does not guarantee playback of every format.
- Song Info with available audio and file details; settings for Album Artist grouping, Play
  Through Folders, track numbers, online album art, and online lyrics. Local and embedded lyrics
  remain available when online lyrics are off; timed lyrics can follow playback.
- Song lengths in library song lists and Up Next, read from the file when the library is scanned.
  Songs whose length can't be read show no length.
- Manual date and time, time-zone choice, and Automatic Time. A new startup animation has a
  selectable Disc body colour.
- On V2.57, screen rotation, volume-key actions, idle power-off, a charging limit, and a choice
  to pause or request shutdown when the Sleep Timer ends.
- Bluetooth Codec selection on V2.57. On other firmware the row says "Not on this firmware".
- Device Info, battery/board temperature, and a reset for diskOS appearance and behavior
  settings that keeps music, network, Last.fm, EQ, and audio settings.
- Signed in-app diskOS updates for later releases. The 1.2.0 release image includes the diskOS
  release key by default; its GUI checkbox, "Allow diskOS updates over Wi-Fi", starts checked.
  Untick it or use `--no-ota` to omit the key; `--ota-key PATH` uses your own public key.
  Settings > System > Update diskOS updates only the diskOS app, not stock firmware or the whole
  image. Allow diskOS Updates can stop downloads; turning it off with a staged update offers
  Discard or Cancel. A trial update offers Keep or Go back and rolls back if it fails to start.
  The first update over Wi-Fi will be a release after 1.2.0.
- A macOS release package for Apple Silicon with prebuilt flash tools.

### Changed

- Album artwork is now decoded by a new helper, `diskos-artdec`, instead of the stock `ffmpeg`
  command (which stock V2.57 ships without image decoders). It runs as a separate short-lived
  process and covers embedded and same-folder artwork on every supported firmware. Cached covers
  are rebuilt once after the update.
- Restart is back in Settings. It waits for diskOS card work and a successful flush; if either
  cannot finish, it reports the problem and leaves the Disc running.
- Library rescans show progress and a Stop action. Cancelling keeps the previous library.
- Playlists retain their order and appear in the stock playlist registry. You can add a displayed
  album, artist, or genre song list, remove a song, and rename, export, or delete a playlist. M3U
  import searches card folders within limits and preserves a differing same-name playlist.
- V2.57 Favourites use the player's favourite queue and row identity. Gain is available on V2.57;
  its Custom EQ editor is view-only.
- Update from SD Card identifies a file named like a stock update and explains the stock route;
  diskOS does not run that update.
- Wi-Fi lists place the connected network first and handle encoded names, passwords, and
  connection feedback more carefully.
- Setup and tool builds now work on Arch, CachyOS, and Fedora as well as Debian and Ubuntu;
  `doctor` identifies the Linux distribution.

### Fixed

- The installer reports a USB-permission problem when it sees a mask-ROM Disc but cannot open it.
- Saving the clock no longer waits on the interface loop for the RTC.
- Album cover caching no longer depends on an inode that can change for the same card file.
  Saved accent colours can refresh when cover content changes.
- Playlist export uses a unique temporary file instead of a fixed name that could overwrite a
  user's file.
- A refused playback send no longer opens Now Playing as if playback started. Delayed local-player
  setup no longer interrupts a song that has already begun. CUE and SACD track replay avoids a
  timeout route reset that could stop a live stream.
- A back swipe starting on a control no longer also taps that control, which could go back two
  screens or change a setting.
- Long one-button messages are no longer covered by the OK button.
- With Weather on Home off, diskOS no longer makes a weather request at startup.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-09-24

A safety release. The stock FiiO player, which diskOS runs alongside, tries to unmount the microSD
card and then deletes everything at the card's mount point, without checking that the unmount
worked. If the card is still mounted, this can delete its contents. The flaw is confirmed in the
stock player on V2.09, V2.28, and V2.40. It has not been proven to be the cause of the two reported
card wipes. Every diskOS user should update; updating requires the complete installer and a new flash.

### Added

- A delete guard in the flashed image, at `/bin/rm` and first on the stock player's `PATH` (so the
  stock fallback and watchdog launches are covered too). It refuses `rm` on the card or anything on
  it; the card's folder can only be removed when it is empty and unmounted. It blocks this specific
  deletion path, not every possible way to lose data.
- A boot selector that runs before diskOS starts and decides once per boot between diskOS and stock.
  Any missing or invalid result boots stock.
- Hold Volume Up for about three seconds to force-close an external app. A message says if this is
  unavailable.
- Extra punctuation in the 14, 16, 18, and 20 px interface fonts, and eight more CJK characters in
  the fallback font. This is not full CJK support.

### Changed

- USB Storage now waits for diskOS to finish reading and writing the card, confirms the card really
  was handed over and really came back, and only then resumes artwork caching. A pending handoff
  survives a UI restart.
- USB Storage is refused during a library scan, and whenever diskOS cannot confirm that the card is
  protected or who owns it. If a handoff is left uncertain, diskOS keeps card access off and asks for
  a reboot.
- Library scans, browsing, artwork, lyrics, book details, playlists, and playback commands wait for
  these card checks. If protection is unavailable, diskOS keeps its card features off and says so;
  the stock player still starts.
- On V2.40, cold-boot card handling tries the direct mount before sending an insert event.
- First-boot setup uses only the UI built into the flashed image; the SD-card fallback copy is gone.
- Restart is temporarily removed from Settings until it can wait for card writes to finish.
- Bluetooth starts off when there is no saved diskOS preference. Saved preferences are kept.
  Turning it on from Quick Settings now waits for it to become ready.
- Home, Now Playing, and Quick Settings share the same transport controls. The play/pause icon
  responds at once. Quick Settings skips 15 s back and 30 s forward in audiobooks.
- Quick Settings allows the transport row only with five or fewer tiles enabled.
- Settings values sit below their labels, controls use the current accent colour, and search fits
  the round screen better.
- Debug Mode's description now says SSH over Wi-Fi; the USB serial shell is for developer builds.
- The installer accepts only the unmodified official V2.09, V2.28, and V2.40 firmware for install
  and build. The untested-firmware override no longer applies to them. V2.57 is refused.
- Release packaging requires the boot selector, its probe and helper, and the delete guard, and the
  image check verifies all of them and the patched boot script.

### Fixed

- Stopping card access now cancels a running scan and all artwork work. A cancelled scan keeps the
  previous library.
- Artwork cache files are flushed to the card before they are used (where the card supports it);
  artwork and playlist exports also try to flush their folder.
- Player start-up and the hand-off to stock have firmer time limits, clean up their helper
  processes, and reset signals correctly.
- Default UI's boot flag is written by a time-limited helper that reports failure.
- Bluetooth status and audio-route checks are time-limited: the check is killed along with anything
  it started, and cleanup never waits without a limit. Bluetooth shutdown no longer waits on the
  Bluetooth service. This closes one way the screen could freeze, not every possible one.
- Scan messages now tell apart refused, running, failed, and finished scans, with a count of skipped
  files. Help hints no longer replace an active message.
- Failed playback, seek, and playlist-export requests now report failure.
- The mode picker keeps showing "switching" until a mode change finishes, and clears the checkmark
  if it fails.
- The boot log keeps earlier start-up messages until it reaches its size limit.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- Install now works from a plain source checkout that does not include the bundled squashfs tools:
  the installer uses a system `mksquashfs`/`unsquashfs` from `PATH` (for example from the
  `squashfs-tools` package) when the vendored copies are absent. `usbboot` and the device files
  remain bundle-only. Previously a source checkout failed with "bundled tool 'unsquashfs' not found"
  even when squashfs-tools was installed.
- Added a squashfs LZO capability check that runs before the build and in `doctor`, so a squashfs
  tool built without LZO support fails with a clear, actionable message instead of failing partway
  through the build.

### Changed

- `doctor` now labels each native tool as bundled or system, flags broken entries, and reports the
  squashfs LZO check result. Tool-not-found guidance points at the correct per-platform build step
  instead of advising a re-download.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- Fixed rootfs extraction on the default case-insensitive macOS filesystem, resolving E230
  `unsquashfs ... already exists` failures from filenames that differ only in case.
  The installer automatically creates, mounts, and verifies a case-sensitive APFS scratch image
  using `hdiutil`, uses it for extraction and validation, then detaches and removes it.
  Cleanup failures are reported.
- Kept the existing build path unchanged on Linux with a case-sensitive filesystem and on
  case-sensitive macOS volumes. Validated on real macOS with `back_home.png` and `BACK_HOME.png`
  coexisting after extraction, and on Linux. macOS device flashing remains unverified end to end.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- V2.40 firmware support, flash-tested alongside V2.09 and V2.28 on Linux x86-64.
- Album cover flow with horizontal swipe navigation, pre-baked cover sprites, and reflections.
  Dynamic album lists and a bounded sprite cache accommodate libraries with thousands of albums.
- Dedicated Books view for single-file `.m4b` audiobooks with saved listening positions, plus
  chapter navigation from Now Playing (jump to a chapter, current chapter highlighted, with titles
  and durations).
- File/folder browsing on the microSD card, with playback of selected library tracks.
  Playback uses the all-songs queue, not a folder-only queue.
- Bundled Noto Sans glyphs for Latin-extended, Greek, and Cyrillic library text.
- On-device UI source under GPL-3.0-or-later, with vendored LVGL and build instructions.
  Installer, build tooling, and documentation remain MIT licensed.

### Changed

- Increased image and writer capacity from 580 to 768 NAND blocks (96 MiB) to fit V2.40's
  roughly 88 MB stock root filesystem, without changing the partition layout.
- Shortened the conservative flash wait; flashing and verification now take about 15 minutes.
- Separated `.m4b` entries from music views and queues, including migration of existing entries.
- Refreshed the circular listening interface and browsing views.

### Fixed

- Refuse undersized or unrecognized writers before any NAND write, and check reported capacity
  after flashing to detect writer/image mismatches.
- Repad older short saved stock images into a separate copy, then validate them before restore.
- Preserve USER EQ presets changed on the stock player when reselected in diskOS.

## [1.0.0-beta]

### Added

- Initial public release for the FiiO Snowsky Disc, flash-tested with V2.09 and V2.28 on Linux x86-64.
- Circular player interface with local playback, bezel and alphabet navigation, M3U playlist import,
  and album-art dynamic colors.
- Experimental weather and Last.fm integrations.
- Graphical and command-line installer using a local Python environment.
- Local image builds from user-supplied official FiiO firmware archives.
- Mask-ROM USB flashing with a bad-block-aware writer and block verification.
- Saved-stock restore, persistent stock UI selection, one-time stock boot, and stock UI fallback.
- Opt-in SSH Debug Mode and separate public and development installation variants.
- macOS build-from-source path, unverified for release artifacts and device flashing.
- MIT-licensed installer tooling, recovery documentation, hardware notes, and third-party notices.
  The initial release distributed the UI as a binary; UI source publication followed in v1.1.0.
