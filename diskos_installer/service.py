"""Application service - the install / restore-stock / remove flows, independent
of any front-end. CLI and GUI both call these with a Reporter and a `confirm`
callback, so the two front-ends can never diverge in behaviour or safety checks.

`confirm(summary: dict) -> bool` is the destructive-action gate:
  - CLI: a y/N prompt.
  - GUI: the CONFIRMATION screen (acknowledge checkbox + explicit button),
    driven from the worker thread via a blocking Event.

Each flow returns a result dict; raises BuildError/FlashError on failure.
