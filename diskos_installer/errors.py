"""Stable, user-quotable error codes for the diskOS installer.

Every user-facing failure carries a short code a beta tester can quote from a
screenshot so we can triage it instantly. Namespaces:

  E1xx  environment / preflight  (nothing written to the device yet)
  E2xx  firmware extract & image build
  E3xx  flash orchestration (host side)
  F1xx  device writer result (mirrors the on-device dbg[16] codes)

An exception's str() renders as:  "[E301] <what happened> - <what to do>"
so existing `rep.error(str(e))` call sites show the code with no other change.
