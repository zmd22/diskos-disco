"""Locate the bundled native binaries and data files.

Layout (in the source tree AND inside the PyInstaller bundle):
    <root>/vendor/<os>-<arch>/   usbboot, mksquashfs, unsquashfs,
                                 my_write6_dram.bin, disc_spl_lpddr3.bin,
                                 lib/ (bundled .so/.dylib for usbboot)
    <root>/payload/              mq_ui, S97diskos_install, S99usbserial,
                                 diskos_manifest templates, etc.

When frozen by PyInstaller, data is unpacked under sys._MEIPASS; in the source
tree it sits next to this package. `resource_root()` resolves both.

A source checkout does NOT include the large native tools (they are .gitignored);
only the small device .bin blobs are tracked. For the STANDARD squashfs tools
(mksquashfs/unsquashfs, which are ordinary squashfs-tools binaries), when no
vendored copy is present we fall back to a system copy on PATH so a plain checkout
works without building. usbboot (a custom Ingenic mask-ROM uploader with no system
equivalent) and the device .bin blobs never fall back."""
