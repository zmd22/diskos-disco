"""Installed-base gate: what the Disc must already be running before a rootfs can be written, and the flash plan that
tells the NAND writer (flash/my_write6.c) to check it.

A diskOS image replaces only the main rootfs; the kernel and the recovery system stay as they are on the Disc. So an
image built from firmware X may only be written onto a Disc whose main kernel + recovery kernel + recovery rootfs are
exactly X's. The writer checks that ON THE DEVICE, in the same USB session, before it unlocks or erases anything; this
module holds the exact identities (from FiiO's official packages, tools/base_catalogue.py) and builds/reads the plan.

Catalogue: every component reassembled from the official update packages and checked against their signed manifests
(size + SHA-256); V2.57's also measured on a real Disc. The recovery VERSION is not an identity: V2.09 ships a different
"recovery 17" build than V2.28/V2.40.
