/* diskos-bootprobe: the bounded, supervised hardware/NAND probe for the boot selector (S96diskos_select).
 *
 * Usage: diskos-bootprobe PREF DATA_MNT DEADLINE_MS [MEMDEV]
 * Prints exactly one line "<flag> <pinrc> <value>" and exits 0:
 *   flag  1 = PREF exists (lstat, any type), 0 = PREF absent (ENOENT only, with DATA_MNT a mountpoint),
 *         E = could not establish either (DATA_MNT not a mountpoint, or any other lstat error)
 *   pinrc 0 = the GPB pin register was read; value = 0x%08x. Anything else = not read.
 * or "T 1 -" when the deadline passed, and "X 1 -" on a supervisor failure. S96 maps everything except a
 * valid 0/1 flag with pinrc 0 to stock. Bad usage exits 2 with no output (also stock).
 *
 * WHY NATIVE: the shell versions could not both bound the probe and keep hold of its identity. Here:
 *  - the probe is a CHILD we never reap before signalling it, so its pid cannot be reused under us - an
 *    exited-but-unreaped child keeps its identity until waitpid. That needs SIGCHLD at its default: an
 *    ignored SIGCHLD survives exec and makes the kernel reap children automatically, so we reset it
 *    (checked) before forking;
 *  - it leads its own process group (set by both sides of the fork, so it holds before either proceeds);
 *  - PR_SET_PDEATHSIG kills it if this supervisor dies, so killing S96 or us cannot leave it behind;
 *  - it reports over a private pipe and has stdout/stderr on /dev/null, so a child stuck in the kernel
 *    cannot hold S96's command substitution open;
 *  - the deadline is CLOCK_MONOTONIC. It bounds how long we WAIT, and a single check made AFTER the whole
 *    result has been received decides whether it is ACCEPTED, so a result that arrives late (e.g. we were
 *    descheduled past the deadline) is never accepted;
 *  - every setup step the guarantees rest on is checked: if the child cannot set its death signal, its
 *    process group or its /dev/null redirection, it exits WITHOUT publishing (reported as "X"), so it never
 *    does hardware work while still holding the caller's stdout or outliving us.
 * A child stuck in uninterruptible NAND I/O cannot be killed until the I/O returns; we do not wait for it.
 *
 * The pin: x2000 pinctrl at 0x10010000, GPB PxPIN at +0x100, Vol-Up = bit 13 (active low). Read through a
 * 4 KiB read-only mapping of MEMDEV (/dev/mem), as main.c did (validated on-device 2026-08-13). MEMDEV is
 * an argument only so host tests can supply a file; S96 passes /dev/mem. */
